Calendar with a SideBar/ Javascript
Building a Calendar using HTML and JavaScript 
The first step is to build the calendar using only JavaScript. The second step is to build an interactive calendar, where the user can add appointments, and events.
The third step is to link it to an interactive pin board, where the user can pin pictures of where they would like to travel, what activites or tours they would like to attend.
